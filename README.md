# AI-Based-approach-for-prioritization-of-genetic-mutations
🤖 This repository provides an AI-powered framework to rank genetic mutations based on their disease relevance.

🧠 It combines sequence data with biochemical features using BLOSUM62 and Grantham scoring.

🔁 LSTM and 📊 1D CNN models are trained to detect sequence and structural mutation patterns.

⚙️ Custom scoring integrates conservation and structural impact for final mutation ranking.

📈 Visualizations highlight high-impact mutations for further research and interpretation.

🧪 Ideal for genomics, precision medicine, and variant analysis workflows.

🔍 Supports researchers in identifying clinically significant genetic variants efficiently.
